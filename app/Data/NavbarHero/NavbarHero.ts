The multi-ethnic fest is a celebration of that culture, which will make us one, we will be united in drums and trumpets, singing like the birds in the morning with hope and passion, swayed by the rhythm, and our ancestors will join us in tune. This three-day extravaganza, from 12th Jan to 14nd Jan 2024, will keep you on your toes with many performances and fun events."
